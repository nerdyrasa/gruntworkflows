# Web Workflows with Grunt.js

Developing a workflow helps with developing, testing, and deploying web applications more easily and efficiently. Tools like Grunt.js make generating workflows as easy as writing a setup file. This is an example of a Grunt-based web workflow that also uses Bower.io to quickly load frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Mustache.js. Many argue that bower is no longer relevant, but I'm glad to have an opportunity to work through an example of its use.
